API-challenge

## How to use:
You'll need to copy the code locally and put in your Spotify public id and secret key and musixmatch apikey to use (in the app.js). 


## Process
This was one of my first times working with JS, I was doing previous exercises before but nothing to this scale. It was a bit difficult for me I won't lie. 

However, I finally understood how API's work and got my website to function.
